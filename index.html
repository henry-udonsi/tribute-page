                The sweet breadth of life<br>
                Dances no longer, silence is her heart<br>
                Set free from her earth binds like a Lyfe<br>
                The one I love, from me departs
                <br><br>
                It was the immortal God <br>
                Called you from us did he<br>
                To sit by his side with thee<br>
                Irrespective of our sob<br><br>
                No goodbyes were said<br>
                Too soon you left<br>
                And so our tears we shed<br>
                For our loved one whose presence we are bereft<br><br>
                I shall never forget her smile<br>
                Or her face weary and kind<br>
                That is my beguile.<br>
                I too shall never forget in kind<br><br>
                Her cold and lifeless face<br>
                Her body in beauty adorn<br>
                As she lays limp in death`s own embrace<br>
                Her life from where it was torn.</p><br>
